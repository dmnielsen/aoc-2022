# Advent of Code 2022

Here lies my overly verbose code for solving advent of code 2022.

## Package details
(So I don't forget next year)

I have templates for each day and a script to automatically set up
skeleton scripts and download the input. If I haven't used the script
in a while, the cookie-based `AOC_SESSION` in `aoc2021/create_new_day.py`
will need to be updated.
